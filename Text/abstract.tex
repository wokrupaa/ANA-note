The first observation of the  \Bs\to\Dss\KS\pim and \Bs\to\Dss\Kstarm decays is reported using 6.0 $fb^-1$ of proton-proton collision data collected by the \lhcb experiment. The $\Dss$ mesons are reconstructed through the decay chain \Dss\to\g (\Ds\to \Kp \Km \pip). The branching fraction relative to that for XXXX decays is measured to be:

\begin{align*}
    \frac{\BR(\Bs\to\Dss\Kstarm)}{\BR(\Bs\to XX)} = XXXX \pm XXX \pm XXXX \\
    \frac{\BR(\Bs\to\Dss\KS\pim)}{\BR(\Bs\to XX)} = XXXX \pm XXX \pm XXXX
\end{align*}

where the first uncertainty is statistical, and the second is systematic. Using a recent measurement of \Bs\to XX  the absolute branching fraction of \Bs\to\Dss\KS\pim and \Bs\to\Dss\Kstarm are measured as 

\begin{align*}\
    \BR(\Bs\to\Dss\KS\pim) = ( XX \pm XX  \pm XX (sys) \pm XX (norm) ) \times 10^{-5} \\
    \BR(\Bs\to\Dss\Kstarm) = ( XX \pm XX  \pm XX (sys) \pm XX (norm) ) \times 10^{-5}
\end{align*}

where the third uncertainty is due to the uncertainty on the branching fraction of the normalisation channel.
